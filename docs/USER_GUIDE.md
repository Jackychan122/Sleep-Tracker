- **Deep Sleep**: 15-20% of total sleep is optimal
  - Important for physical recovery
  - Occurs mostly in first half of night

- **REM Sleep**: 20-25% of total sleep is optimal
  - Important for memory and learning
  - Occurs mostly in second half of night

- **Light Sleep**: 50-60% of total sleep
